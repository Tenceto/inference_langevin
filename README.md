### Bayesian topology inference on partially known networks from input-output pairs

Source code for the algorithm proposed in the paper.

The code in the directory `edp-gnn/` was copied from the original repository (`https://github.com/ermongroup/GraphScoreMatching`) and adapted to be run within our framework.

The plots shown in the paper can be obtained by running `main.py` setting the corresponding parameters within the script. 
The CSVs in `outputs/` are the ones used for the paper.
They can be used to generate the corresponding plots using the notebook `results.ipynb`.

The notebook `simulations.ipynb` can be used to carry out quick experiments on single graphs.
